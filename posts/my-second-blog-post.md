NEW WEEKLY HEIST EVENT the PD EVIDENCE HEIST

It has come to the attention of the Chief of Police that the evidence locker is bursting with high net worth of evidence that needs to be taken to a secure facility and destroyed.

A leak in the PD has reported to local criminal gangs that the weekly event will take place on Saturday between 8pm and 9pm UK time. The armoured transport van will leave from Mission Row PD to Humane Labs where the contents will be safely destroyed.

There will be a server announcement when the PD transport leaves the PD police station.
There will be a 2nd announcement when the PD transport reaches the destination / is destroyed / is lost from PD (i.e hijacked and PD have lost it's location). 

The event rules are as follows:

* Anyone may take part in the heist. 
* PD Police transport vehicle : Riot van (due to its ability to withstand damage) Or suggested Brute Stockade (to be tested)
* If any non-PD on non-EMS are critically wounded (downed) they are no longer able to continue with the heist. This includes if EMS pick them back up.
* Any PD can be revived once by EMS / dedicated combat medic on scene. Otherwise they need to be taken back to pillbox.
  or EMS critically wounded (downed) my be healed and rejoin the heist. This is because we believe there will be a significant number of crims against cops.
* No one must attack or attempt anything before the van leaves Mission Row PD car park. 
* Once the armoured transport van is inside the fence at Human Labs it is deemed secure and safe. People must immediately stop any more attempts at attacking the van or trying to hijack / rob it.
* The contents of the van will be 100k plus (maybe more).
* Do not attack any EMS. 
* The city will potentially go on lock down during the event, so no other crime can be committed.

The expectation that any attempt heisting the van will be well prepared for and planned out. And not just a GTA shootout.
