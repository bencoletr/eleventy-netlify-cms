Please welcome the new Chief of Police, John Dixon! 

John Dixon was a veteran of the Streets of Vice City, busting crime for over 15 years, before taking the big job and moving over to deal with the streets of Los Santos.

He will be leading a new, fledgling force that seems to only ever be growing. He will be joined by trusty **Capt Robert Graves**, who lead the Police Department whilst the Chief was being decided, as well as the crack team of staff rallied by **Capt. Graves** including  **Lt. Cleo Power**, **Lt. Pablo Bojay** and newly promoted **Sgt. Sean Power**.
